Villagers must work together to identify the werewolves hiding among them before itâ€™s too late, while the werewolves must work covertly to eliminate villagers one by one without getting discovered. The game harnesses the power of Arweave's decentralized data storage to store every move, alliance, and betrayal immutably, ensuring a transparent and uncheatable experience.
